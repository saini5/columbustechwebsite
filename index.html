<font size=+1><strong>Introduction</strong></font>
<p>
    Columbus's early life is somewhat obscure, but scholars generally agree that he was born in the Republic of Genoa
    and spoke a dialect of Ligurian as his first language. He went to sea at a young age and travelled widely, as far
    north as the British Isles (and possibly Iceland) and as far south as what is now Ghana. He married Portuguese
    noblewoman Filipa Moniz Perestrelo and was based in Lisbon for several years, but later took a Castilian mistress;
    he had one son with each woman. Though largely self-educated, Columbus was widely read in geography, astronomy, and
    history. He formulated a plan to seek a western sea passage to the East Indies, hoping to profit from the lucrative
    spice trade.
